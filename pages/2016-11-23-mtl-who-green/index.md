You and me, together, we green (not -wash) Montreal.

Here's how:

1. send us on a mission - we amplify
2. communicate, invite others to participate
3. act ensemble - alone it just doesn't add up, we're doing this together
4. invest (your $!) in real projects - who you can meet - who are the people on the ground, making things happen

Join our slack team:

Stand by for the first ever peer-to-peer in-person crowdfunder early next year.

Green in up!
